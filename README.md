# Website Thingi


## Contributing

Website is built using gohugo.io, deployment is done automatically from master branch, no need to run anything manually.

## Development process

Run preview in docker using `make preview-using-docker` command, to deploy manually (should not be necessary) run `make deploy-using-docker`.


## Contributing

Fork the repo and open new PRs from your source branch to original repo source branch. Master branch is updated only via ci on main repo.
